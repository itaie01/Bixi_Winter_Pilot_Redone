# Reimagined Bixi Winter Pilot
This is a personal project undertaken to reimagine the stations picked out by BIXI for thei winter pilot. The goal of this project is to create a more efficient and effective network of stations that will be able to serve the needs of the users better, specifically in the downtown area near McGill University.

This project is ongoing as more consideration into winter conditions and the time it takes to clear certain neighborhoods of snow needs to be better addressed.

## To Do
- [ ] Add more stations to the network
- [ ] Rectify the issue of stations being too close to each other
  - [ ] Incorporate neighboorhoods chosen in original pilot
- [ ] Take snow into account
  - [ ] Take into account the time it takes to clear snow from certain neighborhoods
